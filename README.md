# spotifyDataDoodle-OAuth ðŸŒ‰
When a user logs in to Spotify from [spotifyDataDoodle](https://spotifydatadoodle.herokuapp.com) this code serves as the bridge between the Spotify API and the frontend.
Big shout-out to [mpj](https://github.com/mpj) and his repo [oauth-bridge-template](https://github.com/mpj/oauth-bridge-template) for serving as a template.

Frontend code can be found [here](https://github.com/gustavfahraeus/spotifydatadoodle).
