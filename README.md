# spotifyDataDoodle-OAuth
When a user logs in at [spotifydatadoodle](https://spotifydatadoodle.herokuapp.com) this code serves as the bridge between the Spotify API and my application.
Big s/o to [mpj](https://github.com/mpj) and his repo [oauth-bridge-template](https://github.com/mpj/oauth-bridge-template) for serving as a template.
